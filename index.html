        <h1>Wilderness</h1>
        <p>
          Wilderness is generally defined as areas that have not been
          significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be
          found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches,
          national forests, national parks, and even in urban areas along
          rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and
          protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain
          species, ecological studies, conservation, and solitude. Some nature
          writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and
          creativity,[47] and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an
          integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the
          biosphere). They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that
          they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult or
          impossible to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.

        <h1>Forest Ecosystem</h1>
        <p>
          An ecosystem refers to a functional unit of nature in which living
          organisms interact among themselves as well as with the surrounding
          physical environment. Ecologists look at the entire biosphere as a
          global ecosystem. Besides, the forest ecosystem is a part of the
          terrestrial ecosystem. It, however, may vary largely in size i.e. from
          a small pond to a sea or a large forest. Usually, these are
          self-sustaining. We can divide the ecosystems into two broad
          categories, namely, terrestrial ecosystem and aquatic ecosystem.

        <h1>Protecting Nature to Ensure Our Future</h1>
        <p>
          We often forget how much humans depend on natureThe term that
          encompasses living organisms and the forces responsible for the
          physical world, such as the weather, mountains, oceans, and
          landscapes.. Even city-dwellers living in modern skyscrapers need air
          to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat, all of which are provided
          by nature. True, you can buy bottled water and ready-to-eat meals in
          supermarkets, but they were not produced there. Some fruits and
          vegetables, for example, only grow in tropical countries and cross the
          globe in refrigerated ship containers, to arrive just ripe to your
          local supermarket. All drinking water ultimately comes from a natural
          source, since we still do not have the technology to manufacture large
          amounts of water in the laboratory [1]. The same applies to the air we
          breathe, which is purified and oxygenated by plants [2]. So, when we
          speak about preserving nature, we are really also talking about
          preserving ourselves.
